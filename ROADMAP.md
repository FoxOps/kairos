# Roadmap

**Current version: 1.0.0-rc2** — feature-complete, tested (1340+
automated tests), and used for real team scheduling.

## ✅ Done

**Core scheduling**
- Shift scheduling with day/week/month calendar views, drag & drop
- On-call rotations, generated automatically with a legal minimum
  rest period enforced between two on-call weeks
- Leave management, integrated into the same calendar
- Shift swaps between users, with a three-party approval flow
  (requester → target confirms → admin approves)
- User and group management, with per-group participation in
  scheduling/on-call

**Automation**
- Rule-based automatic shift generation (on-call coverage, rotation,
  weekend handling, minimum staffing)
- Automatic rebalancing of shifts and on-calls when a leave is added
- If a rule can't be satisfied (e.g. no one eligible for on-call
  duty), the affected slot is left unfilled and admins are notified
  instead of silently breaking the rule

**Access & integration**
- Session login and SSO/OIDC (Keycloak, Okta, Auth0-compatible
  providers)
- ICS calendar export (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.), by token or
  session
- A read-only public REST API (`/api/v1/*`) with its own
  service-account tokens, for third-party integrations
- Outbound notifications to Slack/Discord/Telegram/webhooks (via
  Apprise), plus in-app and email reminders
- ICS export tokens expire automatically (admin-configurable duration)

**Security**
- Static code analysis (Bandit) and dependency vulnerability scanning
  (pip-audit, no API key required), run automatically on GitHub Actions
  before every release, once a week, or on demand

**Operations**
- Multi-language (French/English) and multi-timezone, per user or
  organization-wide, including on-call status computed in the
  organization's own timezone rather than the server's
- An audit trail of who changed what, browsable by admins
- Database backups (local or S3-compatible), schedulable via cron or
  triggered from the admin UI
- Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes health/readiness endpoints
- Docker image and Kubernetes manifests provided for deployment

## 🔧 In progress

**1.0.0-rc2** — addressing feedback reported against `1.0.0-rc1`
(tagged, see the `1.0.0-RC1` tag/release). The `1.0.0-rc1` production-readiness
audit itself is done: dependency updates, dead-code removal, N+1/SQL
query optimization, i18n completeness (French *and* English),
documentation accuracy, a full security audit plus a live penetration
test (2 real findings fixed — see `report/SECURITY_AUDIT_v1.1.md` and
`report/PENTEST_v1.md`), load testing, and a dedicated bug hunt — landed
as a series of themed, individually reviewed pull requests.

## 🔭 Future ideas

Larger features, not yet started, not committed to a timeline.

- **Configurable automation rules.** Rules used to generate shifts and
  on-call rotations (weekend handling, minimum staffing, rest periods)
  are currently hardcoded in Python — a config file or an admin UI
  would let each team adapt them without touching code.
- **On-call intervention reports.** A way to log what happened during
  an on-call shift (time spent, actions taken) — useful both for
  payroll and as an audit trail of interventions.
- **New access-control roles**, beyond today's admin/user split (e.g.
  HR, auditor) — for people who need to see scheduling data without
  being able to change it.
- **Write support on the public API v1.** `/api/v1/*` is deliberately
  read-only today (listing shifts/on-call/leave/users) — adding
  create/update/delete would mean re-validating the same
  conflict/weekend/leave rules already enforced by the internal
  session-based routes, without duplicating that logic. A real
  candidate for a v2, not started yet.
